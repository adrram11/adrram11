## Hi there 👋

<!--
**adrram11/adrram11** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a fan parody game in Renpy called "Romance High: Revamped". It is based off of the CRK April Fools 2023 event. (Search it up if you don't know what I'm talking about.)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about Renpy coding and Python in general.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on mostly Renpy projects.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with more advanced Renpy and Python code.
- 💬 Ask me about my upcoming game!
- 📫 How to reach me: I am most likely to respond on Discord. My user is LicoriceLover511.
- 😄 Pronouns: she/they
- 🌺 Fandoms: CRK, PJSK, TOH (the show, not the roblox game), TADC (i'm a bit ashamed of this but i still really like the show)

- ⚡ Fun facts:
- I both have usernames adrram11 and LicoriceLover511 on most of the social media sites you can think of
- I'm obsessed with Licorice Cookie from CRK (it's kinda obvious-)
- My favorite coding language is Python
- I got accepted into a coding program called Veritas AI, and it was ran by Harvard/Harvard graduates. I even got a 50% scholarship despite filling out my application last-minute! (You thought it was free or something???)
- I participated in a hackathon once, but sadly, my team did not win... 😞
- I did a coding summer program and it was really fun beacuse I got to see my cool ELA teacher from last school year again 😎
