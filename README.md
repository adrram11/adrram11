# Hi there! 👋
- I'm mostly trying to learn Renpy and Godot coding right now.
- I’m currently working on a fan parody game in Renpy called "Romance High: Revamped". It is based off of the CRK April Fools 2023 event. (Search it up if you don't know what I'm talking about.)
- I’m currently learning more about Godot, Renpy coding, and Python in general.
- I’m looking to collaborate on mostly Renpy and Godot projects.
- I’m looking for help with more advanced Godot, Renpy and Python code.
- Ask me about my upcoming game!
-  How to reach me: I am most likely to respond on Discord. My user is LicoriceLover511.
- Pronouns: she/they
- Fandoms: CRK, PJSK, TOH (the show, not the roblox game), TADC (i'm a bit ashamed of this but i still really like the show)

# ⚡ Fun facts:
- I both have usernames adrram11 and LicoriceLover511 on most of the social media sites you can think of
- I'm obsessed with Licorice Cookie from CRK (it's kinda obvious-)
- My favorite coding language is Python
- I got accepted into a coding program called Veritas AI, and it was ran by Harvard/Harvard graduates. I even got a 50% scholarship despite filling out my application last-minute! (You thought it was free or something???)
- I participated in a hackathon once, but sadly, my team did not win... 😞
- I did a STEM/coding summer program and it was really fun beacuse I got to see my cool ELA teacher from last school year again 😎


I might add more things to this README later idk- 🤷‍♀️
