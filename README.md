# Hi there! ♥︎
I'm mostly trying to learn website making right now.
- I’m currently learning more about HTML, CSS, JS, Renpy, and Python.
- I’m looking for help with more advanced Javascript, Renpy, and Python code.
- Ask me about my website, Renpy game, or just about my current projects in general!
- How to reach me: I am most likely to respond on Discord. My user is adrram11.
- Pronouns: she/they
- My website: https://femtanyl03.neocities.org
- Fandoms: CRK, PJSK, TOH (the show, not the roblox game), TADC (i'm a bit ashamed of this but i still really like the show)

# ✦ Fun facts:
- I have the username adrram11 on most of the social media sites you can think of.
- My favorite cookie from CRK is Shadow Milk Cookie.
- My favorite "real" coding language is Python (not counting modified versions of other languages).
- I got accepted into a coding program called Veritas AI, it taught Python coding and it was ran by Harvard/Harvard graduates. I even got a 50% scholarship despite filling out my application last-minute! (You thought it was free or something???)
- I'm doing the program again this year and making a therapy chatbot.
- I participated in a hackathon once, but sadly, my team did not win... :C
- I did a STEM/coding summer program and it was really fun beacuse I got to see my cool ELA teacher from last school year again >:D


I might add more things to this README later idk-
